# Plotly-Belly-Button-Biodiversity

Created an interactive dashboard to display bacteria that live inside the human body.

## Project Overview
The Module 12 projected consisted of creating a dashboard to show information about the bacteria that live inside a human's belly button from a sample of hundreds of people.  The dashboard allows the user to visualize each person's demographics information, top 10 bacteria found, how frequently they wash their belly button, and the bacteria cultures per sample.
